**Resources**

Welcome
=======

This site is a list of resources of personal interest, in a number of fields. The selection is somewhat random, and in no particular order. I mostly keep these lists so that I can find them later, but I hope they are of use to you as well.

This site is formatted using [Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep). Source can be found in the associated git repository.
